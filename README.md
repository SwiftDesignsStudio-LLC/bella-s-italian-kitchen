# Bella's Italian Kitchen Website

A modern, responsive restaurant website built as a real-world demonstration project for **Swift Designs Studio**.
This project showcases how a restaurant can display its menu, location, and reservation information online to attract more customers.

## Project Purpose

Many local restaurants depend only on Yelp, DoorDash, or Google listings.
However, restaurants with their own website gain more control over branding and customer experience.

This website demonstrates how a restaurant website can:

* Present a professional brand identity
* Display menu items and pricing
* Show hours and location
* Allow customers to make reservation requests
* Increase direct traffic from Google searches

This project simulates a real restaurant client that can be customized and deployed for an actual business.
